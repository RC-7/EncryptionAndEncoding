In order to view the results of the various experiments, run the MATLAB function called main. This function runs each of the necessary
functions and displays the appropriately named output in the console window. Please note, should the main file produce errors when run, it
may be due to the version of MATLAB being used. As such, a published version of the main function code and results may be found in the
main.pdf file.
